TODO: Write a more detailed README and verify these steps work on fresh environment

Pre-requisite: Nodejs v10 is required to be installed on the machine in order to run this. Might work on other versions, but I haven't tested that

1. Run "npm install".
2. Run "grunt build" to compile the application. The compiled application will end up in a directory called "dist".
3. Finally, run "grunt run" to launch the application. The app is available on localhost:3000
